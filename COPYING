II: Licence governing the assets:
    All sounds, images and other ancillary data found in the ./gfx (except for
    the backgrounds - please see the note below), ./bgm, or ./snd directories
    is made availble for reuse in other projects under the terms of the Creative
    Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license; more information may be found at
    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_US .

    As an exception to the above, the large space backdrops in ./gfx/background
    in the initial commit are all modified Hubble images, and as they began life
    in the public domain, they should still be considered as such - all I did was
    crop and/or shrink them to texture-friendly sizes.
